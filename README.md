# Arch makepkg sandbox

## What is it ?

This repo contains a simple Dockerfile and launch script intended to create and test ArchLinux [PKGBUILDs](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Creating_packages).

## But why ?

I found some Docker images about **building** ArchLinux packages with `makepkg`, but not actually testing and creating it. I wanted something really simple in which I would be able to work and test my `PKGBUILDs` easily.
